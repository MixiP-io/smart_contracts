# MixiP Smart Contracts

![Version Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/VERSION-v0.2.0-blue?style=for-the-badge)

## Project Motivation

Stellar is a network capable of supporting thousands of transactions per second while maintaining low transaction fees. In addition, Stellar has a global anchor network of on/off ramps. So we can offer fast, secure, and reliable cross-border payments that are cost-effective for our users and essential for the problem we aim to solve.

Soroban is an ideal solution for our business as it allows us to automate payments once media assets are approved, using cross-contract calls with token contracts that interact directly with classic Stellar assets.

## What is coming up
With Soroban we want to build out an underlying structure for IP rights at the asset level. The media asset information is recorded in a smart contract, which owner is the creative, so even if the media asset is delivered there is always a record in the blockchain of who is its author. In this way, we can ensure that our creatives' work is properly protected.

## Current System overview
The following image illustrates how the smart contract manage the assets payment process.
